# Advent of Code 2021

These solutions to [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) are written in Clojure.
You'll need [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) or [Babashka](https://babashka.org/) to run them.

Either execute `clj day1.clj` or `bb day1.clj` to see the result for the problem of day one.

## Development

If you don't have a favorite development setup for working with Clojure yet, you could consider the combination of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the [Calva](https://calva.io/) extension.
